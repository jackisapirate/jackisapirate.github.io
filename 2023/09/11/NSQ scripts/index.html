<h1 id="When-Do-You-Become-an-Adult"><a href="#When-Do-You-Become-an-Adult" class="headerlink" title="When Do You Become an Adult?"></a>When Do You Become an Adult?</h1><p><em>MAUGHAN: Angela, we have a fascinating question today about adulthood.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: “Adulting” or adulthood?</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Well, adulthood, I think, but I think they’re tied together, and I don’t know that I’m good at “adulting.” I don’t know how you are at “adulting,” but it’s kind of forced upon us at a certain age.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: It is.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: So, here’s the question: “Who decided, and when was it decided, that the age of 18 years old is considered an adult? Why hasn’t this evolved with our understanding of human brain development? Thank you so much for considering my question, Alison.”</em> </p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Oh, so nice, Alison.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Yeah, I think this is a great question — my favorite is like, “Who decided?” Like, “Who, who are you to tell me that 18 is an adult?”</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Do you know the answer to that question? Because I know the neuroscience and the psychology on that question, but I don’t know who decided it was that at the age of 18 we are able to vote and do some other things.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: I weirdly do know the answer to that, but before we jump into that, I want to ask you a question first. Was there a time in your life when you finally felt like, “I’m an adult?</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: I think in high school, I actually did have a little vague feeling about this, and it’s partly because my parents, whom I loved and who were caring, were very occupied with raising my older brother and sister and they were a handful. And so, the kinds of things that some parents do, like, “Hey, it’s time for your physical,” or like, “You should probably get an eye exam,” or, “It’s time to send out Christmas cards. And maybe we should put out a jack-o’-lantern because it’s Halloween.” So, basically I did all those things in high school, and they are kind of adult things. So, obviously that was all before I was 18, but honestly, I think my first load of laundry — like, you know that first load of laundry that you do completely by yourself, and you’re, like, paying complete attention to the task. You’re like, “And then the dryer sheet goes in the, dryer.” Like,  I think the first load of laundry I did,   I was like, “Now I am an adult.”</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: See, I think I thought of when did I become an adult, and I remember moving to college — which by the way was 45 minutes away from the home I grew up in. And I thought, “I am an adult now. I’m moving out. I’m on my own.” And those first two weeks, I called home maybe 12 times, because I was so homesick. And I thought, “Maybe I’m not as much of an adult as I thought I was.”</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Did you drive yourself? Your parents didn’t drop you off?</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: No, and that is so funny because it’s become a conversation in my family. My parents were always just like, “Hey, good luck!” My friend Dave Smith and I packed my family’s Suburban — I took half the Suburban, he took half the Suburban — for all of our stuff, and we listened to Billy Joel’s “Moving Out.” And I thought I was an adult, but then I realized that maybe I still need my mom and dad.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Well, I absolutely cried when my parents dropped me off. And I remember distinctly the feeling of watching the car get smaller in the distance. And there was just this, like, sinking feeling, and it was like, “I want my mommy.” But yeah, there are these transitions, and, you know, psychologists have been thinking about this forever. But you said you bizarrely know the answer to this. So, who decided that 18 —</em> </p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Right. So, Alison, I’m going to answer that. First of all, there’s this thing called “age of majority,” which is different than what’s called the “legal age of license.” So the age of majority is when you are legally considered an adult and fully responsible for your own actions.</em>  </p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: So, that’s 18.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Most places now view the age of majority — or age of adulthood, if you will — as 18. Now, there are a few states in the United States — Alabama and Nebraska, for example, say the age of majority is 19. Mississippi says the age of majority is 21. That does not mean, however, that you can’t vote or any of those things.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: That’s federal, right?</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Right, and so, legal age of license, which is slightly different, that’s when, for example, you can participate in certain activities like drinking alcohol. What’s interesting is the historical fluctuations. And the age of majority, fluctuated over time between being the mid-teens and mid-twenties for what’s adulthood. So, if we go back to the Romans, because everything goes back to the Romans.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: At least over here, in this part of the world. Go on, yes.</em> </p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: The Romans in the early days considered 15 for males. They said that’s when they have obtained the intellectual capacities required to exercise full citizenship, manage their affairs, become parents, and the heads of families themselves. Now, for anyone who’s met a 15-year-old, God bless the 15-year-old Romans.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Okay, wait, I need to interrupt you very briefly and say it’s possible that 15-year-olds back then were not the same as 15-year-olds now.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Yes, 100 percent true. But basically this is because they were correlating adulthood with puberty. And the onset of puberty roughly was 15 for males back then. What’s interesting, though, is that they still didn’t trust these 15-year-olds completely, so they would place them under temporary guardianship of adults who were known as “curators,” and the curators would validate any formal action that the 15-year-old took until they reach the age of 25. So, it’s kind this, like, balance between you’re an adult at 15, but you’re a supervised adult for 10 years.</em>  </p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Okay, so this is the historical origin of 18. So it started off as 15.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: But then it changes.   As the nature of warfare changes, we start to think of adults differently. Hop with me for a minute over to England. So, in the Middle Ages, think about all the weight of defensive armor. And so the age of eligibility for knighthood turns into age 21, because that was when they felt like you could be an actual warrior.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Like, you were strong enough.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Right. And so they change it to 21 if you’re in the military. But the age of adulthood stayed about 14 or 15 if you were an agricultural status. So, I should just say, for centuries, the tradition spread widely because of the role that the English played — 21 became that age of adulthood in much of the world. But it was, once again, war that changed it in the U.S. to 18 because we didn’t have enough people that were entering the military. So, in 1942, Congress lowered the age of conscription into the military from 21 to 18, and then that led to the 26th Amendment in the United States, where it was like, “Hey, look, if you can send me into war at 18, then I want to be able to vote at 18.”</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Ah, so voting followed the draft.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Yes, because it was like, look, if you can send me into war, I should be able to vote for who my leaders are. And then, kind of everything flowed from there, that 18 became the age. And it’s so interesting that so much of it comes down to warfare. Not psychology, not brain development, not maturity, but warfare.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: So, in the kind of like, “Well, who decided?” It sounds like there are political — I guess you could say pragmatic, but definitely political forces that say 15, 18, 21. Okay, back to 18. Well, 21 for this, 18 for that, right?</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Or if you’re on the farm, then we need you to be an adult earlier, versus if you’re out there fighting a battle, we’re going to call it something different.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Well, the thing you said about there are two bright lines —   you said there’s an age of majority, which is kind of a confusing expression except for when you think of children and teenagers as being minors. I guess that’s why it’s called the age of majority. You are no longer a minor. But then, there is the blah, blah, blah, blah about license? What was that phrase?</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: The legal age of license.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Somehow, like, that phrase sounded, like, so long to me, but okay, again, the legal age of license. So, that being a different bright line, that’s a different demarcation for adulthood, at least in terms of our laws. So, that one was, you said it was like drinking, for example, and —</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Yeah, and they can match up or they might not. So, if you look at some of the history: when Prohibition ended in 1933, most states set the drinking age to 21, which at the time also equated to the voting age. That continued until, again, we talked about this —.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: We needed soldiers, yeah, the draft.</em> </p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Yeah, that’s when we moved the voting age to 18 with the Constitutional Amendment. A bunch of states, in turn, lowered the drinking age to 18. But then, in 1984, President Reagan comes in and he says, “Look, you need to raise the drinking age because of drinking and driving.” It became this massive national problem, especially on kids who hadn’t quite developed the brain function, etc. So, he basically strong-arms all of Congress to pass this National Minimum Drinking Age Act, where he said that if states don’t raise the drinking age from 18 to 21, then he would cut funding for their federal highway funds. So he forced all these states to raise the drinking age to 21, but it had been 18.</em>  </p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Until Reagan? I did not know that. And are all states in the United States 21 for drinking?</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Yes, so every state abides by the standard of age 21 for drinking.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Okay, so here’s what I want to say about the age of majority and the legal age of license. So, when you’re a child, you’re a child. And when you’re an adult, you’re an adult. And I guess different societies have made the bright line differently. But there’s also this stage that is in between childhood and adulthood. I think every society would agree that it’s not childhood to adulthood, it’s childhood to adolescence to adulthood. One of my favorite adolescent psychologists is Larry Steinberg. And he is one of the world experts on this transitional stage, right? I think one thing Larry would want everyone to know is that all mammals have adolescence. It’s a phase that is biological, and it is this transition sexually. So, you know, the hormones change, you develop the ability to reproduce. And during that stage, you actually also engage in a bunch of behaviors that are true across mammals. And I find this fascinating, because there is a kind of teenage phase — even for, like, mice and rats.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: I’m just thinking about, like, elephants being teenagers and, like, getting in trouble and testing the rules.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Right. I think what’s so funny is that during this stage, you know, adolescent mammals do, like, stupidass things, like, risk-taking, sensation-seeking behaviors. And so, one of the things that Larry has thought hard about as a prominent adolescent psychologist is: when should these bright lines be made? And he’s smart enough to understand that no policymaker can handle like, “Well, it shouldn’t be —” like, you need to have bright lines. He kind of understands that even though there’s complexity, you cannot govern a society where you’re like, “For this, it’s 16 and a half, except for if this person hasn’t reached this milestone.” I mean, he gets it.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Right, that’s what’s so tricky, because the development of individuals is not uniform, but to your point, from a policy-making standpoint, you can’t have just a mushy middle forever, so we have to draw these lines.</em> </p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: So, he has these two lines as well. So, he wrote this article in 2019, so not that long ago with a postdoc named Grace Icenogle, and it’s entitled, “Using Developmental Science to Distinguish Adolescents and Adults Under the Law.” And, you know, he summarizes decades of research, including the neuroscience on brain development. And he says, “Look, we need two lines. Here’s one line.” And this line comes earlier. By age 16 — Larry wants to argue, and I would agree with him — it’s at that age at our capacity to reason logically is actually fully mature.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: At 16?</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: At 16. Now, by the way, you can point to these 16-year-olds and you’re like, “Seriously?” But he makes this distinction. He said it’s in cool decision-making contexts. In other words, like, not emotional, not peer-pressured. But if you actually give 16-year-olds logic puzzles, and, like, reasoning puzzles, they are just as good, if not better, honestly, than many of their older family members. For example, voting, you know, thinking about the upcoming election when obviously our voting rules are not going to change. I think Larry would argue that 16-year-olds should be fully capable of reasoning in a cool context. Now, you might not argue that this election is a cool context, but I think this is what he means.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: And “cool” not meaning, um, fun, popular. Cool as in, like, non-emotional.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Oh, yes. Not Stanley Cups and Adidas Sambas, but, like, “cool” as in not emotionally hot.   He says, it’s a different thing when you’re asked to make decisions in a hot context. That’s one that, you know, there’s time pressure, there’s peer pressure, and there’s something emotional. Like, say you’re angry. That’s actually where teenagers get in trouble. Teenagers actually do not get into trouble in, like, pencil and paper hypothetical scenarios. They do not make stupid decisions. But when they’re with their friends and they’re in these, like, emotional, anger-inducing, or embarrassment-inducing, or, and also, you know, I mentioned this, like, thrill-seeking and sensation-seeking. Whenever I talk to undergraduates, I mean, I sound like that old person, but I do tell them, I’m like, “If you can get through this period of time, as you move into your mid-twenties, the urge to do those stupidass things, it just fades. Like, this one kid in my class was like, “So Dr. Duckworth, do you mean this? When I was a kid, well, not that long ago, actually, I guess I was in high school, there was a steep hill near my house. And I would ride my bike to the top of the hill, and then I would go down as fast as I could, with no brakes, right through an intersection.”</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Oh my gosh.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: “Again and again, because it was fun.” And he was like, “And Dr. Duckworth, I, I kinda think that’s crazy now, like, I would never do that.” And I’m like, “Yeah, that’s what I mean.”</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: So, here’s this distinction, though, that sounds like you’re making is: this kind of cold-decision making. In other words, like, the rational, thoughtful, analytical, logical. And then, there’s the hot, and the hot takes a lot longer to master, if ever. I don’t know that any of us ever master this idea of peer pressure, frankly. I mean, I think we’re maybe less susceptible to it.</em>  </p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: I think he wants to say 21 — and by the way, you know, he’s not saying that, like, a miracle happens between 20 and 21 on that day. But again, he’s a practical guy. So he was like, you know, a society has to have laws and the laws have to have round numbers and you need that unambiguous separation. But the reason why he says 21 is very much informed by brain research. So, like, basically, the prefrontal cortex — you know, the part of your brain that sits right behind your forehead — it is the last to develop in evolution, and it’s the last to mature in your life. And so, for anybody who has young people in their lives, you should just know, like, this part of the brain continues maturing structurally and functionally well into your twenties. And there’s some disagreement about exactly how long, but part of Larry’s reasoning about age 21 is that that part of your brain that is in charge of impulse suppression, task switching, working memory, all that stuff, that is the part of your brain that you absolutely need to be had on, you know, high alert and in high functioning when you’re in an emotional hot decision-making context. And the other reason I know that Larry thinks about 21 is because when I told you about the sensation-seeking impulse — that is really strong throughout your teens, and it starts to fade. And so, I think that’s why Larry wants to say, and I’ll quote him from his article, “Some of the legal situations that require mature self-regulatory capacities: driving, consuming alcohol, gambling, resisting impulses” — these are the ones that a society should set a legal boundary that’s possibly as old as 21. He also mentions 18. But it’s not 16.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: I do know that Angela and I would love to hear your thoughts on what it means to be an adult and when, if ever, did you start to feel like a grown up? So, record a voice memo in a quiet place with your mouth close to the phone and email it to <a href="mailto:&#78;&#83;&#x51;&#64;&#x46;&#114;&#101;&#97;&#107;&#x6f;&#110;&#111;&#x6d;&#x69;&#x63;&#115;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#109;">&#78;&#83;&#x51;&#64;&#x46;&#114;&#101;&#97;&#107;&#x6f;&#110;&#111;&#x6d;&#x69;&#x63;&#115;&#46;&#x63;&#111;&#109;</a>. And maybe we’ll play it on a future episode of the show. Also, while being an adult is hard, sharing a podcast is simple. So if you like the show and want to support it, please do the responsible grown-up thing and tell your friends about it. You can also spread the word on social media or leave a review in your podcast app.</em> </p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Our view of what an adult is, I think changed a bit. And I, I look at this</em> Atlantic <em>article I read by a woman named Julie Beck: “When Are You Really an Adult?” And it talked about how this transition to adulthood used to be this big collection of markers:  getting a job, moving away from your parents, getting married, having kids. But what we’re seeing is this massive trend across the United States, but also happening in many societies globally, where people are getting married later, having kids later, moving out later, or maybe even as adults living with their families. And so, adulthood isn’t always still associated with age of your body, it’s not always associated with the development of the mind, but rather we have these constructs. And I think one fascinating thing I listened to recently was from Trevor Noah, who’s the comedian, wrote one of my favorite books,</em> Born a Crime. <em>But he talks about this almost infantilization of singlehood. And that we treat single people as sort of not fully-formed adults, because we have this preconceived notion that adulthood should include all those things that Julie Beck listed in her article.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Well, okay, that is its own super interesting debate. I thought you were going to say Jean Twenge when you said</em> The Atlantic*, because Jean Twenge is — well, she’s a professor of psychology at San Diego State University and she’s very famous, actually, for writing in places like* The Atlantic.</p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Yeah, and we’ve talked about Jean’s work before.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Right. So, she wrote this paper with another professor named Heejung Park, and it’s called “The Decline in Adult Activities Among U. S. Adolescents, 1976 — 2016.” So, over this 40-year span, fewer teenagers in the United States engaged in what she calls “adult activities.” I guess we could debate that. And here they are: having sex, dating, drinking alcohol, working for pay, going out without parents, driving. And so, she’s documenting that there is this shift. Now, I do want to give you, like, the evolutionary argument for all of these changes. The human body, we go through puberty. And in that phase all these things come online. For a long time, I think people thought like, “Oh, it’s biology.” Like, somehow your cells know on a certain day to change. You know, the testosterone or the estrogen starts flowing. But one of the major theories in evolutionary psychology right now is called life-history theory, and it says that these things that you think are just fixed and just are, like, on some kind of cellular clock, they’re profoundly influenced by experience and there’s an evolutionary reason. If you sense that you are in a chaotic, uncertain, and dangerous environment, you better get to adulthood fast. Get to adulthood, reproduce, and get the hell out of there. You don’t have a lot of time. But so this life history theory says, like, what if you have the sense that you are in a stable, rich, secure environment, where you’re probably going to live for years and years? Well, then you have an incentive effectively to forestall puberty and whatever line you want to give yourself for being in adult roles, and whatever responsibilities, and everything. And here’s why. It’s the period of childhood and also adolescence where you learn the most. So, this theory says that you can procrastinate on adulthood if you live in a secure world, because then you have time to learn from your parents and to go and get more educated from your peers and to develop skills. So, this life history theory is actually one of the things that Jean Twenge draws upon. She also thinks that social media as an invention is a major reason why people are, like, not going out as much and doing some of the things that teenagers used to do.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Well, I think it makes a lot of sense that your body’s ability to say, hey, I can postpone puberty because I’m in a safe environment versus the evolutionary response to I’ve got to reproduce. And, and you look at marriage and the age for marriage, in previous societies girls would be married as — and current societies in some parts of the world, there’s still lots of teenage marriage. For example, in Iran, there were 35,000 marriages between March of 2017 and 2018 of girls who were between the ages of 10 and 14, 170,000 marriages of girls between 15 and 19. So, there’s still this idea in some parts of the world, but certainly in other times, it was very customary to get married at a very young age. Mary the mother of Jesus was 14, they say. I have no idea who came up with that number, but biblical historians would say that, right?</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: I did not know that.</em> </p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: So, this idea, I think, that goes along with this concept that you’re talking about. With a less stable environment, with a lower lifespan, there was just this, we’ve got to go reproduce earlier.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: I mean, one of the things that I had to look up actually at some point — and you know, I am, in some respects, an adolescent psychologist, so I kind of can’t believe that I had to look this up. But the age of puberty. So, puberty actually is starting biologically earlier than it used to. And there’s an evolutionary argument for that too.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Wait, it’s starting earlier? See, I would have guessed the opposite.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: That’s why I had to look it up!</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Because they’re in a more safe, stable environment.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Now you’re making me feel less stupid, because I was like, “Wait.” Just thinking about this life history theory, you’re like, “Oh, well, you’ve got time. Isn’t that why we’re going into adulthood later? Like, there is some sense to that. So, there’s evidence from one of my very favorite neuroscientists. Her name is Allyson Mackey, and she studies the developing brain. There’s evidence that our molars, you know those big teeth in the back of your mouth, this emergence of permanent molars, the molars that you don’t lose — her research shows that the more early life stress you have, the earlier your molars erupt. And she would argue, in this life-history theory context, that would be consistent with people who grow up in secure, enriched environments are sort of waiting, right? The pace of development is slowed down so you could capitalize on learning and exploration. So, I don’t think we’re wrong to think, like, “Wait a second, wouldn’t puberty be later?” But here’s the complexity of the human condition, Mike. Like, other things are also true. And one of the reasons why puberty is a movable event and it’s not preprogrammed into your cells that it’s like, okay, exactly on this day, is that other things also influence, including nutrition. So, that’s the big thing. So, when an animal has enough food, and also you have to as a female predict that you can make it through pregnancy and then nurse this child. Anyway, we are consuming more calories and we’re consuming a lot more calories than we did in childhood than we used to. And so, that is I think probably the biggest — I don’t know, but I would just venture a guess that lots of things are going on, but one of the things that’s going on is that we eat so much more.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Just raw calories.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Just raw calories. And so that makes the age of puberty go earlier. So, it’s complicated, but let’s just put two facts together. If the age of adulthood is getting later, and the age of puberty is getting earlier, then you have this extended adolescence. And some scientists would say, like, that is a historic event, that we have this adolescent period, where you’re not strictly a child, but you’re not fully an adult. It really is an unprecedented phenomenon.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: And I don’t know that any of us know yet the good or bad ramifications of it. Angela, I wanted to just bring up, as we close this conversation, a survey that was done by resumetemplates.com that got a lot of press.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Ohh, that sounds, uh, extremely verifiable, resumetemplates.com?</em> </p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: It shocked me.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Okay, I’m going to hold my breath. Go on.</em>  </p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: They asked 1,400 Zoomers, which is kind of the Gen Z — they call them “Zoomers.”</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Oh, that’s a thing? Okay, “Zoomers.”</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: But, they asked them a bunch of questions about jobs, and job interviews, and resumes, and stuff like that. And they found that 10 percent had had their parents write their resume. Sixteen percent of respondents said their parents had submitted job applications for them. But this was the number that shocked me most: 26 percent of Gen Z respondents said that at one point or another they had brought a parent with them to a job interview.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: What? They brought their mom or dad to their job interview? I can’t believe — is that possible?</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: I would immediately invite both to politely exit the office and never come back. Now, maybe in fairness, they meant, “I got a ride.” I don’t know. Anyway, my point is this: that was a shocking stat to me. And sometimes in our prolonged adolescence, maybe we’re doing it wrong if that’s what we’re doing.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: I mean, I have heard complaints — you know, as a university professor, right? I teach — I guess you could call them adolescents between 18 and 22. Some scientists, by the way, want to argue for a new term because, you know, if you’ve got this adolescent period that’s so long, they’re like, “How about if we rebrand the part of this life course that’s between 18 to 25,” so think about, like, basically your college years and your first job. There’s some people, most prominently Jeffrey Arnett, who’s a professor of psychology at Clark University, he wants to rebrand that as “emerging adulthood,” or he wants to say that’s, like, a distinct developmental period. At any rate, I teach these adolescents, or if you want, you can call them “emerging adults.” But it is interesting, because I have heard stories, complaints from my fellow faculty who are like, “This kid had their mom call me about their quiz grade. Like, I used to get these annoying complaints from the students themselves, and now I’m starting to get complaints from parents who are like, “Excuse me, professor, but, you know, I think this grade was unfair —” Like what? So it is interesting.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: That is mind-blowing.</em> </p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: I take back “interesting.” Mind blowing. Horrifying. Catastrophic.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Yeah, interesting was the nicest way you could possibly say that.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Yeah. I will say this. I grew up in this neighborhood where everybody had a bar mitzvah or a bat mitzvah other than me. Because it was a highly Jewish area. And I lost count, but I think at some point I had, like, 27 bar mitzvahs or bat mitzvahs in, like, a year. I remember one day I went to three. Of course, this is a ceremony where you enter adulthood at a single point in time. And it’s not the only tradition where, you know, you were a child and now you are not a child — you are an adult. But I didn’t have that ceremony, not being Jewish. So, then I you know, wondered like, oh, well, if I don’t have this rite of passage, you know, when does it happen for me? I do think, and I have long thought, that the United States — maybe because we’re so diverse, right? Maybe because we’re a melting pot — or choose your metaphor — we don’t actually have a consensual — like, we don’t have how do you say it? Quinceañera? Is that the — you speak Spanish.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: When you’re 15, you have a quinceañera, yeah.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Quinceañera. But, like, many societies have a rite of passage, as it’s called. Like, we are going to, as a society, induct you into the next chapter of your life. And it’s not this, like, super gradual, maybe at some point, you’ll wake up one day and feel like you’re on the other side of the line. And I have long thought that the United States would benefit from some kind of clear social ritual — not a private ritual, but a social ritual — where you can say, “Now you’re an adult and here are the responsibilities.” So, I know this is not going to happen. Like, I don’t get to legislate this.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: “Everyone must throw a party at this stage.”</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: We could agree on that.</em> </p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: See, I always viewed high-school graduation as sort of that moment. It’s a lot of pomp and circumstance. You’re 18, usually, I mean, when you’re graduating. It’s not an individual celebration, like a bat mitzvah, or a bar mitzvah, or a quinceañera, but it is sort of that ritualistic, like, you’re crossing a stage, you’ve now completed —.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: That’s right. You’ve, like, donned a gown. By the way, most rites of passage have these things: like, everybody shows up in a certain costume, there are songs —</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: And rituals associated with it.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Yeah, there are people of authority who usually, like, say the same thing over and over — I mean, it is like a bar mitzvah or a bat mitzvah. So, funny that you thought of that as high-school graduation. Now, some would argue it has to be college graduation. Obviously not everyone goes to college. But then some would argue that you go to these college graduations, you hear “Pomp and Circumstance,” people go out to dinner, and a lot of people would say, and I would agree with them, that those 22-year-olds are not thinking like, “And today I’m an adult.”</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: It’s a fair point. So, Alison, thank you for your question. Who decided? Sounds like warfare and the Romans a little bit. When was it decided? I think that what Angela and I have discovered is that it’s still being decided. And thankfully, we have a lot more science and neuroscience and understanding of the brain nowadays. But I will just say, as my closing remark, if you ever want to really be considered an adult, don’t ever, ever bring your parent with you to a job interview.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: And it’s never too early to start doing your own laundry.</em> </p>

<h1 id="What-Does-It-Take-to-Survive-a-Scandal"><a href="#What-Does-It-Take-to-Survive-a-Scandal" class="headerlink" title="What Does It Take to Survive a Scandal?"></a>What Does It Take to Survive a Scandal?</h1><p><em>MAUGHAN: Angela, we have an amazing question today about scandal.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Scandal? Like the um TV show?</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Not the show. Sorry, I know you got very excited about Kerry Washington here. “Hi</em> NSQ*. Over the last few years, so many celebrities, leaders, politicians, and public figures have been ‘canceled’ for a range of things from ignorant and thoughtless to egregious and appalling behavior. Some of these people have been able to recover their reputation completely, while others appear to have had their image irreparably and permanently damaged. Why does society forgive or forget some of these behaviors, but not others? And is there a particular formula for successful recovery from a scandal? Best, Anonymous.”*</p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Mm, I love this question</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Here’s my take: they’re anonymous, so maybe this is like, “Hey guys” —</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Oh, is this like, “I have a ‘friend’ who got canceled. Any advice for my ‘friend’?”</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Asking for a quote, “friend.” Okay so, one, I will just say that the data is clear on this — just anecdotally you would know this anyway — but the number of public apologies and cancellations, whatever, have become so vast that they’re just everywhere nowadays.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Wait, scandals are up or apologies are up?</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: All of the above. Is there a scandal, or a public apology, or a cancellation that really sticks out to you in your mind?</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Okay I actually have an answer to this, but it’s, it’s old. So, Monica Lewinsky and I were interns at the White House in the very same summer.</em> </p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: What?!</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Yes! That particular scandal is one that I had a front row seat to, in a sense. I only met Monica Lewinsky once during that summer at a party. And I do recall therefore paying even more attention than most people — I think most people were pretty glued to their screens — during the proceedings. But I have wondered, why is it that — well, many people have forgiven Clinton for that scandal. I guess some have not, but you’re exactly right. Sometimes these scandals unfold in ways that are like, oh, suddenly everybody’s embracing this person again and other times not. So, anyway, yes. That is my scandal story.</em> </p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: That’s one of the ones that sticks out most to me. Now, partly it’s our age and where we were in our formative years. And I was, I think, in high school, and it was this massive media frenzy. But here’s what I think is interesting: it was so anomalous and rare back then that something like that stood out massively.</em>  </p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: The scandal and the apology? Or just the scandal?</em> </p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Both. We now live in what — and I don’t remember who coined the phrase, but someone called the “Age of Apology.” There’s a professor of political science at the University of Houston, Brandon Rottinghaus, who talked about, like, how scandals don’t hit like they used to partly, he posits, because media and politics are so divided. When something comes out about X person did this or Y person did that, one, often people only get one side of the story. But two, we exercise justification so much that we are like, “Well our side can’t have done anything bad,” or we rationalize away instead of holding people to sort of the same standard regardless of which political affiliation they have.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: I do actually think there’s a psychology of taboo, which is underlying why we consider some things a scandal versus, like, oh, a bad thing.</em> </p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Right. Okay. Say more about this.</em> </p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: So, every society has these unthinkable acts, these bright lines that you do not cross. Even, like, naming them is like — You know, they, they make you take a deep breath. And I think what you’re saying is that in a polarized society where there is less consensus about the moral right and wrong, even about taboos, which are usually consensual in a society, — I mean, that would suggest that, like, only half of the country is scandalized and the other half is like, “Meh.”</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Yeah. I think it’s kind of that, right? I, I think, one, fewer things are considered taboo in today’s day and age.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Like, period.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Well, think about it. I mean, having a child out of wedlock you were ostracized, scarlet letter, all these things.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Right. Not being the dominant religion was also a taboo and would therefore lead to scandal.</em>  </p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: So, there’s so many things like that, but I’m not sure that it’s because different parties consider different things taboo. I think it’s that different parties will justify their own person’s behavior or scandalize someone else’s behavior, not using different standards of what’s bad, but just saying like, “Because you’re ‘other,’ this thing was terrible.” Or, “Because you’re of my same party, I’m going to justify your behavior.” And it’s like, “Oh, well, I can rationalize that,” or, “That’s the worst thing I’ve ever heard.”</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: You mean depending on their party affiliation, whether they’re Democrat or Republican.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Yes.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: So, you would predict that scandals would be perhaps on the rise if you’re like, “Yeah, I’m going to be scandalized by the thing that the other party is doing because I am so anti that party”? Is that what you’re saying?</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: A hundred percent. One of the things that Rottinghaus, who I just talked about, that professor, also talks about is this idea of staff, basically. So, if you think about it, often the people who survive the scandal are in power versus the people who work for them. And I’ll never forget, there was a, a movie that came out when I was in grad school, and David Gergen — who’s famously counseled, I don’t know, seven, I think, different presidents  — a very well-established White House advisor. He watched the movie with us, and then we had a Q&amp; A after, and it was a movie about —</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Is he a Republican or a Democrat?</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: He’s served presidents of both parties. And we watch this movie about campaigns. And in this movie, one of the staffers, for example, had had an affair with the candidate. She got pregnant. She is basically forced to have an abortion. There are all these people covering it up. Da da da. Afterwards, we have a Q&amp;A with David Gergen and several other people who’ve been high-ranking individuals on both Republican and Democratic presidential campaigns. And they’re like, “Look, I know many of you are going to go work in presidential politics. Be careful.” Staffers in a scandal are more likely to be sort of thrown off to the side.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: So they’re saying, like, word to the wise: if you are the underling and you are involved in a scandal, in theory, you should be the one exonerated because you had less power, but, in fact, you are more likely to be the one not forgiven.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: You’re one that they’re going to try to use to cover themselves up, and you’re still the one who’s going to get tossed to the curb.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Now, this didn’t happen for Monica Lewinsky, right? Because I don’t think Monica Lewinsky was canceled.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Oh, I think Monica was absolutely canceled.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: You think so? She was, like, a kid!</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Monica Lewinsky basically went into hiding for a couple of decades. She is considered, in many ways, the first example of cyberbullying, because the internet was just at its dawn. She became the butt of every late-night joke. I mean, if you think about it, like you just said, she was in essence, just a kid who had had an affair with the most powerful person on the planet.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Right, if you want to make an argument about power dynamics, the President of the United States and then an intern. What could she have been? Early 20s at most? So, she was cyberbullied. Of course,  maybe not by a majority of Americans, but by —</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Oh, I think the majority of Americans.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: A majority of Americans thought she was in the wrong?</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Definitely held her accountable and cyberbullied her. Her name became synonymous with scandal. I think we in many ways ruined her life. In fact, I only met Monica Lewinsky once, and it was after she put out her TED Talk where she basically, I think 20-something years later said, “I am going to reclaim my story.”</em>  </p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: No, I totally respect this. I’m just still a little open-jawed. I mean, the last time I saw Clinton on a television screen, you know, I was watching the Democratic National Convention and his extremely long speech. I would argue that Bill Clinton is not canceled today, otherwise they wouldn’t have him at the Democratic National Convention, correct?</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Well, I think that Bill Clinton was not canceled for a long time. Then the #MeToo movement came about and it re-shined a spotlight on his behavior. Obviously, he’s not canceled to the point where — he, as a former president, just spoke at the Democratic National Convention. There were a lot of news articles that came out, though, that basically say, “Hey, Democratic Party.” And these are from, you know, Democratic operatives or other less-biased sources, and they’re just kind of like, “It’s time to move on past Bill Clinton. His behavior was egregious in the past and we shouldn’t continue to have Bill Clinton be part of these events.” It’s — I don’t, I’m making up a term now, but almost like a “soft cancel.” Let’s kind of move on. And also, like, I just think we can’t talk about being canceled and — I don’t know what you call it —  welcomed back into the fold, without also looking at   sexism, racism, and privilege. I think there are a lot of stories about how different crimes are covered in the news, and it may be reported very differently if it’s a Black male from a low socioeconomic environment versus a white male from a place of privilege who’s attending maybe an elite university. Maybe we let certain people with privilege, whatever form that privilege takes — money, better looking, different family situation, et cetera — back into the fold differently. I don’t have data, but we have to acknowledge that in the world in which we live, when we let people back into the fold versus permanently excommunicate them, there are other factors that weigh in on that that are, are not right.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: So, we might be more readily forgiving of people for reasons that have nothing to do with their guilt or innocence —  that it’s not so simple, right? I guess regardless of whether scandals are up or down, you know, whether we’re, like, morally outraged more or less and why, I did hear about this, like, “Age of Apology” in an academic psychology paper. And this paper, actually, they say: what is the effect of the increasing number of apologies on how apologies are received? And I think maybe that is in a way the heart of this question for our dear listener, Anonymous.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Right. Let me, if I could, just share a couple of apologies, and then maybe you can dive into the psychology. Ben Ho is a economics professor at Vassar and Karen Cerulo is at Rutgers University and is a cultural psychologist. So, Ben Ho in a 2018</em> Freakonomics Radio <em>episode, one of our sibling shows, talked about how to optimize your apology and he focused mostly on this idea that an apology has to be costly to be effective. And he’s talked about two types of costs specifically. One is the status apology. He basically said you admit incompetence, you ask for forgiveness, and then in some sense, you make yourself look stupid. An example he gave is, “I’m sorry, that was completely idiotic.” If it’s done sincerely, then that has some real reputational cost. The other one he talked about was the commitment apology, which he posits can be even more powerful and it’s this commitment to do better in the future. So, the example there, “I messed up, I know what I did was wrong. Moving forward, you can hold me to a higher standard.” That one’s riskier because it backfires, obviously, if you don’t —</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: When you don’t follow through.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Yes, hundred percent. So, now moving to Cerulo quickly — she did a study of 183 different apologies over a 13-year period, from 2000 to 2012. And she looked at only highly-visible apologies, and what I mean by that is every apology was covered in at least five or more distinct news outlets. All of them had public polling data attached to them. And she then looked at people’s reactions to determine whether an apology was effective or not. Some examples: Marion Jones was an Olympic athlete who was caught doping. Kevin Rudd was the Prime Minister of Australia. He apologized on behalf of the nation for removing Aboriginal children from homes and placing them with white families. And so, his was more an institutional apology.</em> </p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: That was historical probably, right? He was not directly responsible for that.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: He was, yeah, not around at all, but said, “Let’s finally make an apology for this.” So, my point is there’s this vast difference in all the public apologies that she looked at. And she said the most successful apologies followed a similar pattern — and the least effective ones. Most successful, you focus on the victim. So you start by talking about who is hurt, talk very little about yourself or any personal justifications, and then you end by talking about how sorry you are. If possible, you make restitutions. Now, I know this is a little obvious, but she says that in all of her research, she was surprised at how few people could make an effective apology and said that of all of these she studied over this decade-plus period, less than a third of public apologies were effective with the public based on poll data.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Meaning, I think, that, like, we don’t forgive those people. So, maybe if you want to say, what does it mean to be canceled? I mean, there’s no, like, dictionary definition, I think, that you could be like, “Oh, that’s what it means to be canceled.” But I think there’s an absence of forgiveness, like, you are not forgiven. And so, these are ways that you can be forgiven and welcomed back into the fold, these two research studies.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Yes, and these focus more specifically on apologies that led to forgiveness.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: But only one out of three did in that last study that you mentioned. Okay, so the things that she said is, like, you have to focus on the person who was wronged, not on yourself. And then you have to sincerely and abjectly admit wrongdoing.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Right, I mean she even goes so far as to use the word at one point, “mortification,” and defines it as “the unequivocal expression of shame, guilt, or remorse.” I mean, you have to express that you are mortified by what you did. So her advice is, is very simply: don’t wait. So, forget your ego, forget everything else, apologize immediately. Don’t apologize for what people thought; apologize for what you did. So, too many people come out and say, like, “I’m sorry that people misunderstood me.” “I’m sorry people misinterpreted that.”</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Right, or, “I’m sorry that you feel that way.” The classic, “I’m sorry that you’re so upset.” You’re like, “Oh my god, I want to kill you.”</em>  </p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Turns out that doesn’t work.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Turns out that just puts kerosene on the fire.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: So don’t wait, and then apologize for what you did, not what people thought. Don’t give context. I thought that was interesting. It totally makes sense to me. She said, “People don’t care why you did it. Why you did it is less important than just expressing regret and remorse.” We don’t need context. We just need to say, “Hey, I’m so sorry. What I did was wrong.” So, when it comes to Bill Clinton’s apology, Cerulo she said the number one issue with his apology was one, it took so long to be made and then it was made so many times because he did such a bad job,  but eventually, he got to the National Prayer Service where he was doing an apology there and she and others say that that is the most effective one when he actually showed sorrow that looked genuine and actually even named Lewinsky, apologizing to her and for what he’d actually done. And I think Angela and I would love to hear your thoughts on what it takes to successfully recover from a scandal. So, record a voice memo in a quiet place with your mouth close to the phone and email it to us at <a href="mailto:&#78;&#x53;&#x51;&#x40;&#102;&#x72;&#x65;&#97;&#107;&#x6f;&#110;&#111;&#109;&#x69;&#x63;&#115;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#109;">&#78;&#x53;&#x51;&#x40;&#102;&#x72;&#x65;&#97;&#107;&#x6f;&#110;&#111;&#109;&#x69;&#x63;&#115;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#109;</a> and maybe we’ll play it on a future episode of the show. You can also spread the word on social media or leave a review in your podcast app.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: So, you know, forgiveness is its own mystery, covered in enigma, you know, swirling in the unknown.   But if you just assume that there is such a thing as being forgiven, and we do sometimes do it, the question of like when we’re forgive— I mean, I think most people are not going to experience being canceled, but I think all of us will do something at some point where we wish to be forgiven. You know, this professor of economics at Vassar you mentioned, Ben Ho, I was like, why do I know that name? He was a co-author on the paper that was on Uber and on apologies.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Yes, yes!</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: And I know Stephen Dubner and I’ve talked about this but I’ll just recap it, because it’s so clever. It was published in 2021. But the origin story is that John List, who was I think the chief economist for Uber at the time. And Uber had chief economists so that they could do really clever experiments that would help them have a better app. And John, one day, orders an Uber and it doesn’t come, and he’s really pissed off and he decides to study what happens when you’re a customer of this app and you’re just so angry because it failed you. And the operative question was like, is there anything Uber can do to make it up for you? Can they repair this ruptured relationship? So, when a rider on Uber had a trip that was in the bottom 5 percent of time of arrival for your particular geographic region, then you were then randomly assigned to different apology conditions. Some people would get an email that would say, like, “Here’s a $5 gift card to your next ride.” The basic apology was like, “Oh no, your trip took longer than we estimated.” There was a status apology, like, language like, you know, “We know our estimate was off.” So, sort of taking some responsibility. And there was a commitment apology, by the way, like, “We’re working hard to give you arrival times that you can count on.” And one of the major findings was, quote, “Money speaks louder than words.” I think when you said   an apology should be costly, to quote the paper, “The best form of apology is to include a coupon for a future trip.” But applying it personally —</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Sorry, I just have this image of like, “Hey, I’m so sorry for something egregious.” And I’m like, “Here’s $20.” In a personal view, it sort of cheapens the apology, but I totally get it from a corporate standpoint.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Yes, I don’t think you really want to, like, Venmo people directly after having, like, a blowout fight with your best friend or something.   But the larger point is the costliness. I think actually, just to speculate, why it is that that rings true to us or that moves us more is maybe that we have a little bit of an “eye for an eye.” You know, maybe it’s part of human nature to say, like, “You hurt me. It’s only right that you get hurt.”</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: There’s a silly</em> Modern Family <em>episode that I love where —</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: I love</em> Modern Family*! They’re all silly, and they’re all amazing.*</p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: But there’s one where Gloria, who is this beautiful Colombian young-ish woman who married Jay, you know, the grandpa. And she’s basically the same age as Jay’s daughter. So, the stepmom and the daughter are basically the same age, and the stepdaughter, who’s Claire had at one point called Gloria a “gold digger.” And that comes out at a family dinner, and Gloria is upset and she said, “What do I need to do to prove to you all that I really just love your dad? I’m not in it for the money.” And she’s like, “Here, take the bracelets back, take the earrings, take the whatever.” And Claire comes up to the, the room and apologizes to Gloria and says, “Hey, I’m really sorry. I shouldn’t have said that. When you first started dating my dad — I mean, look at you, look at him. You’ll understand why I had some concerns. What can I do to get your forgiveness?” And interestingly, in this “restitution” sense, Gloria says, “I want you to go jump in the swimming pool with all your clothes on.”</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Is that what she says? I don’t remember this. Okay. So, then what happens?</em>  </p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: The family goes outside and Claire is standing at the edge of the pool. And she’s like, “Wait, are you really going to make me get in? Like, I’ve shown I’m willing —”</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: And you have to know Claire is, like, the uptight person who would not jump into the pool with her clothes on.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: So she says, “Are you really going to make me do this? I’m standing at the edge of the pool. I’m showing you that I’m willing to jump in.” And Gloria just looks at her and says, “Yes. You have to jump in.” So, Claire jumps in with all her clothes on. And then next Jay, the older gentleman, pushes Gloria into the pool. And then the whole family jumps in. And this idea of restitution, while it wasn’t monetary, there was some cost that she had to pay, but it also turned into this joyful act of forgiveness where it was this memorable moment where the whole family is in the pool with all their clothes on —</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Okay, I’m going to go, like, way out on a limb and now interpret that episode of</em> Modern Family <em>as if it were a parable from the Bible, okay? So, like, if Claire were, like, dunked into the water, right, and then everybody’s, like, sort of laughing at her, that would not have been a good ending. But then what they showed is that she was truly welcomed back into the fold. Such is the brilliance of</em> Modern Family. <em>Yes, there’s a costly apology, but it then follows with true forgiveness and like, true acceptance.</em> </p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Versus a public shaming.</em> </p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: And I think what this research is showing is that there is some instinct we have that there has to be a true cost   to the person who was the transgressor — maybe it’s because we have some base instinct for an eye for an eye. We’re like, you have to jump into the pool and, like, be slightly humiliated in the way that you made me feel humiliated when you called me a “gold digger.”</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Which by way, I don’t think those were equal offenses. I think “gold digger” is much more offensive than making someone jump in a pool. But, they had negotiated this, and I love how you said it was not a public shaming where everyone then ridicules Claire.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Yeah, it’s actually also not an “eye an eye.” By the way, a $5 coupon is not the same thing as, like, “Okay, now I’m going to make you five minutes late.” You know, “I’m going to make you miss a flight,” right? So, it’s not exactly that, but I still think it has this, like, base note of, like, restitution or symmetry. But then, I think for there to be — because you said this, I think, about Ben Ho’s research. Like, what makes an apology effective is not only that you can see that this costs me, but also this commitment that you have to follow through on in the future. I’m also thinking about other research on body language of apologies. There was an article in</em> Journal of Personality and Social Psychology <em>about embodied remorse. And it’s about when you make a public apology, whether you include a physical display of remorse or you don’t. So, the two physical displays of remorse, one is getting down on your knees.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Oh, come on.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: I’m not kidding.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: No, I believe you. But like, that doesn’t have a place in public apologies.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: You’re like, when has that happened?</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: And also, like, if anyone got on their knees to apologize, that’s so dramatic, it just feels not useful.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: You’d be like, oh, it must be insincere because it’s so melodramatic, almost.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Yeah. I’m, I’m really interested to hear more about this but I call immediate B.S. Like, who’s going to get down on their knees and apologize?</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: In the paper that I’m talking about, there were descriptions of an actual historical event. Do you know about the Tokyo Electric Power Company and the nuclear disaster?</em>  </p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: I think there was one about 10 years ago. I don’t remember anything about an apology. I do remember that there were these elderly Japanese men who worked there who basically said, “To go fix this, we’re going to go in, because we’ve lived good lives, and we’re going to make sure that younger people don’t have to be exposed.” And it was this beautiful example of self-sacrifice in order to kind of bless generations. That’s what I remember, which has nothing to do with apologies or scandal.</em> </p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: I mean, I’ll say that in this experiment, you’re just a volunteer, right? Now, time has passed. But you’re told about this, you’re given factual information about what the disaster was, and then also, you know, the public statement that was made. You know, there was a, an image. And it says, you know, when you’re looking at these materials, like, “The picture below is a still, a still photo, from the press conference.” And then, there’s two conditions. In one condition, the representatives of the company are sitting at a desk in front of microphones, but in another condition, in the treatment condition — in the “embodiment” condition, they would say — in that condition, the representatives are away from their desks, kneeling with their palms pressed to the floor. So, these are both true photos, it’s just that they’re taken at different times. But, the embodiment condition — I don’t think American executives would do this.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: That’s what I was going to say. I wonder culturally if there’s a very different sense of that.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Yeah, no, you’re not going to get anybody in, like, American culture to, like — it just, it’s not in our vernacular, right? Like, we don’t do this. So, it would be so odd. But they did have other studies where, instead of kneeling, there was, like, crying. So, there have been actual public apologies where the transgressor seemingly spontaneously — one could get more cynical than that — but they’re crying as they issue their apology. And either way, crying and kneeling are nonverbal.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Crying I buy, by the way. Like, I’ll be susceptible to that.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: You might even buy kneeling just within that cultural context, right?</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Exactly. And that, I want to acknowledge. Mine was an ethnocentric reaction to that.</em>  </p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: So, this embodiment — right, so seeing pictures of people like physically, either with crying or with kneeling, you know, showing their remorse — it actually did increase the viewer’s ratings of, like, how much you think this person does have remorse. In other research, I have generally found that, you know, sometimes it’s easy in the world of texting and email to miss the importance of nonverbal cues. This is one reason I think people will always need to have some face-to-face contact to have truly meaningful relationships. By the way, if you’re going to apologize to someone, I’m going to go out on a limb and say, don’t do it by text. Don’t DM the person. Because these nonverbal cues and also tone of voice in other research that I’ve done is, like, so important. You, you don’t get that in a text message. But the take-home of this multi-study investigation is that it does matter for how much people think you’re sorry.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: You’re saying “it” being body language.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Yeah, this kind of embodiment. It also matters for being perceived positively. So, the transgressor, we have more empathy for them, et cetera. But one of the interesting things about this research is that this embodied remorse did not have any significant effect on being forgiven in, actually, any of the studies.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: So, I just think it’s more sincere, but I’m not more likely to forgive you.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: And this is why forgiveness is so interesting to me. Like, what is it to be forgiven? Because   we can know that you’re sincere — and I’ve experienced this too. So, you know, I’ve shared with you before that Jason and I rarely have arguments, but when I get mad, I mean, I really — you’ve never seen it, but I get really, really, really mad. And I have wondered to myself, why is it that if Jason is sincerely sorry, I can see that he’s sincerely sorry, and yet I still don’t forgive him. Like, what is that? I don’t know, it’s something which is still beyond my understanding as a psychologist. I mean, I have to bring up: so my therapist, Dee, has given me this expression that has been so useful — and again, I have more interest in private apologies than public apologies. I mean, I hope I don’t have to ever make a public apology, but I think the dynamics are the same. So, Dee says that all relationships are such that there is going to be rupture and repair. And what she means by this is that any relationship — including ours, Mike, right? Like, that there will be a time where trust is ruptured, where understanding is ruptured. And then, they’re repaired. So, I think to me, the art of apologizing is about, you know, repairing that which has been ruptured, and I think these pro tips are great, you know, don’t wait, be sincere, don’t talk about extenuating circumstances, own it, commit. But for me, that phrase, “rupture and repair,” has been like a guiding light, because it also tells me that it’s normal. Maybe scandals are not normal, but like, you should expect friendships to be ruptured, and then you should expect them to be repaired. The thing that I’ve always been raised with is, like, forgiveness is always the right thing to do. So, if you have been either a victim or a bystander, like, the morally higher road is to forgive — maybe not to forget, but to forgive and to repair.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: I will say, I’m with you 100 percent on a personal level. I know that I am human, and I know that I make mistakes all the time — hopefully not of the egregious variety. Like you, I hope there’s never a public apology.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: Hopefully, not at scandal-level.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Right. But yes, I think that we all have occasion to apologize every day. I will say that I hope I am very forgiving to others because I want people to be forgiving to us. And I wonder — again, maybe in the societal framework of scandal and being canceled —  I wonder if part of it is for some people we cancel them because their behavior is so obviously and systemically bad that we view that as a reflection of their character versus there are some individuals who committed an act.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: It was a terrible action, but they’re not a terrible person.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Right. And so we can put in context — Harvey Weinstein had perpetual, abusive, horrific actions against so many women over so many years that we have the context to say, “You’re not welcome back.” Whereas an individual who made a mistake, I hope we also have, as individuals and society, the willingness to say, “I’m not going to judge you by your worst day.” I hope people would grant that same grace or forgiveness to me.</em></p>
<p><em>DUCKWORTH: I mean, I think the thing that you’re saying is that there is no formula for successful recovery if this is like a deeply motivated, persistent character flaw. And if it isn’t, then there are these, like, tactical things. Like, if you really just screwed up, but you’re basically well intentioned, then apologize immediately and do it with body language and have a little skin in the game and commit to doing differently and follow through on that commitment. But if on the other hand you are Harvey Weinstein, we don’t have a recipe for you.</em></p>
<p><em>MAUGHAN: Yeah. I’m so sorry.</em>  </p>
